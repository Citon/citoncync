# Add include/exclude patterns to this file - See the
# rsync man page

# Examples:
# # Skip .mp3 files
# - *.mp3
# - *.mpeg3
#
# # Skip ISOs, but do include ISOs starting with the name "archive"
# + archive*.iso
# - *.iso

# The default is to include - So add "- *" at the end if you want this
# list to be explicit
